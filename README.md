# Milo's-refuge

Milo is a cat who wants to create a haven of peace for cats. He will bring in more and more cats.  
His feline friends will gather resources in a peaceful world and prepare food to sell to expand the refuge, explore new lands, and evolve their refuge.  
It's a farming game that consists of fields on different islands. Each island has special characteristics and can accommodate different types of plants and animals.   
Harvests can be improved to obtain more resources.  
The resources are brought back by boat to the main island where they will be used to craft food which will then be sold to obtain money, buy new islands and improve harvests.  
The goal of the game is to produce as much money as possible by improving the fields and the livestock.  
Only calm piano music.
