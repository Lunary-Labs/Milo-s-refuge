# Roadmap

## 1st step (complete)

- [x] Basic wheat field (timer, harvesting, indicator, animation)   
- [x] Boat that departs when full  
- [x] fix boat
- [x] Simple design of a basic island  
- [x] First recipe (bread)
- [x] Camera 
- [x] Wind Mill
- [x] cooking
- [x] Island upgrade (size)
- [x] UI first page draft
- [x] Camera drag/scroll
- [x] Wheat field
- [x] Auto/Manual collect

## REFACTOR (complete)

Need to rewrite parts of the code to remove excess amount of variables :  
- [x] Boat ressource handling  
- [x] Island ressource handling   
- [x] Character ressource handling  
- [x] Cookers  
- [x] Cooker interface
- [x] All the datas like island costs and max levels should be in a json file

## 2nd step

- [ ] In game UI  
- [ ] Sounds (click, harvest, etc..)  
- [x] Island upgrade (size)  
- [x] Field upgrade (growth speed)  (level increase but is not effectively affecting speed, need to decide formula)
- [x] cats upgrade (harvest speed)  (level increase but is not effectively affecting speed, need to decide formula)
- [x] boats upgrade (speed, capacity)  (level increase but is not effectively affecting speed, need to decide formula)
- [x] Interface for upgrades
- [ ] harvest pop up (+1 wheat for example)  
- [ ] Boats bezier curves or anything to can make then do a nice curve.  
- [ ] World switch (including money and materials lists switch too)
  
## 3rd step

- [ ] missions module
- [ ] cutscene module
- [ ] Tutorial module (will prob use the cutscene module)

## 4rd step  

- [ ] Save/Load  
- [ ] settings menu
- [ ] credits
- [ ] resposive if we change resolution ?

## 5th step  

- [ ] decide game economy (how much ressources for each action) and balance it  
- [ ] Decide how to handle upgrade, the progression curve etc..
- [ ] write story and missions (with milo's dialogues)  
- [ ] Create cutscenes and islands

## details  (mainly ideas)

- [ ] Bringing life to the ui, with little cats emote everywhere, no static elements
- [ ] events on the water, some would be interactible, like a box that you can take.
- [ ] develop cat ai, maybe they could interact together if they are near each others.
- [ ] island harvest sounds when the camera is getting near to the ground. maybe birds and cats sounds too.
- [ ] lots of clickable elements that add nothing but life to the game. could click on a static cat to make him jump (happy happy happy) for example.
- [ ] Milo should emote based on what we do (in bottom left corner) and go away/sleep if afk

## Additional features that could be added

- [ ] An housing system with buildable and terraformable island.
- [ ] Prestige mode, restarting everything with a boost (quite uninteresting)
